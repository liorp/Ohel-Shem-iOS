?CAN I USE ALEF FOR ANYTHING
Yes you can!
You can use Alef for print, tv, apps, personal use, commercial use, tattoo it on your back, whateverâ€¦ In the zip file you would find both files for the web and for installing on your computer. If you want to create a new font based on Alef, you'll have to call it by a new name, to credit us and to release it under the same license. Enjoy!
(and if you go ahead with that tattoo, do send us a picture)
